  <h1>Chocolate Balls</h1>
  <img src="../images/Chocolate Balls.jpg" alt="A plate of nealty stacked swedish chocolate balls garnished with coconut flakes">
  <p>Chokladbollar are absolute classics of the Swedish bakery. Chocolate balls are standard in most Swedish cafés and it is hard to imagine the confectioners’ refrigerated display cases without them. These chocolate balls from Sweden are not only very delicious and savoury, but they are also very easy to prepare.
    Almost every Swede has eaten or prepared chokladbollar at some time or another. For many Swedish parents it is customary to introduce children to baking and kneading the dough together, and rolling it into balls. A quick sense of achievement, and above all tasty.</p>
